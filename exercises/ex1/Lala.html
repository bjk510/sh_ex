      <h1>Laa-Laa</h1>

        <p><i><b>Laa-Laa is very girly </i></b> . She likes playing with her ball, singing and dancing and doing ballet in the skirt and sings 
          <i>'Laa-Laa-Li-Laa-Li-Laa-Li-Laa'</i> to herself, hence her name. <br> When Laa-Laa gets frustrated, she sometimes shouts a rather strange word 
          <i>'BIBBALY-CHEESE'</i>. She is often seen to look out for the other Teletubbies. She is a silly and cute Teletubby, and most of the time she has a cheerful personality.
Laa-Laa often hangs out with  <a href="Poo.html"> Poo </a> and <a href="Dipsy.html"> Dipsy</a> and  and even occasionally with <a href="Tinky Winky.html"> Tinky Winky</a>. <br> She once saved <a href="Dipsy.html"> Dipsy's</a>  Hat from being blown away by the wind. Laa-Laa is 6 feet and 6 inches tall. She is the second smallest after <a href="Poo.html"> Poo </a>.
