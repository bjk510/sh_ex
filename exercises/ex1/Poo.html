        She is the silliest problem solver, the best "spider-fighter" of the Teletubbies, a tomboyish type, and of all the Teletubbies, she is the one who usually becomes most involved with the audience. She loves both attention and her curly red circular aerial on her head. In the Teletubbies' house, she sleeps on the right side of all the other Teletubbies and sometimes eats Tubby Toast while the others are sleeping, which explains where she sleeps on the far left. Po is also a bit timid, and a little less talkative than the other Teletubbies. She likes cute stuff and often hangs out with <a href="Tinky Winky.html"> Tinky Winky</a> and <a href="Lala.html"> Laa-laa</a> too.
